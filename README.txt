To reset the admin's password, run server.py to start the server, then webscraper.py to do the rest.
The password reset is handled automatically and the admin's new password is determined by the new_password variable.
Both the URL for resetting the admin's password and the new password itself are printed, so to login as admin, simply enter the new password.
